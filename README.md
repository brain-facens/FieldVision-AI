# FieldVision AI

https://github.com/brain-facens/OCR-notas/assets/64169072/8078be88-cb17-4616-9e03-8646b638b623

API for processing text on invoices, with the aim of identifying relevant fields on an invoice and optimizing bonus or validation systems. Making life easier for logisticians, merchants and managers, the application has an interface that captures images from the webcam, processes the image using OCR and provides a visualization of the results obtained.

## First Steps

This project was developed to run a web interface, where the user will have access to the image capture system and the data processed from that image. Follow the steps below to use this project, the stable version is in the main branch.

### Requirements

The following requirements should ideally be met for proper operation:

- Ubuntu 20.04 (Original development environment, but compatible with 18.04 and 22.04)
- Docker Engine or Docker Desktop
- Python 3.8
- Git
- Anaconda/Miniconda
- Create a virtual environment for the project if you want to work without conda;
 
  ```
  conda create --name fielvision python=3.8 --channel https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/free/

  # Activate the environment
  conda activate fielvision
  ```

---
**Warning!**
**We recommend that you use the Docker container developed for this project, as the application is stable. This avoids the risk of incorrect installations, path errors and library versions.**

---

### Installation 

Local:

```
# Activate the environment
conda activate fielvision

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/brain-facens/FieldVision-AI.git
